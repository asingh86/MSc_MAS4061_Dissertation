Thinking I had made a mistake, I initiated a chat with customer service, and they were nice enough to give me a refund so that I can order the correct card instead. I ordered the Print at Home option again, double-checking to make sure I chose correctly. The gift card actually shows up as &#34;Email Delivery&#34; in your cart when you go to checkout. Thinking this was a glitch I stupidly ordered it again, and got the same result. An &#34;Email Delivery&#34; card sent to myself, with a giant Amazon logo. I contacted customer service again and got them to give me a refund again even though this item isn't supposed to be refundable.

What they don't realize or evidently care about is that to find out if &#34;I&#34; liked my experience, they'd need to contact the despicable, loathsome, contemptible, reprehensible individual(s) that hacked my Amazon account and stole my debit card information in order to purchase themselves two $100 gift cards. They then went on to attempt to purchase a $500 gift card as well but then Amazon finally got wise and realized that my account had been hacked so they shut down that purchase and alerted me - which I thought was fantastic and was happy to see that they were &#34;on it&#34;. But I was sadly mistaken. When I called to talk to them about it and to let them know that I had the $200 come out of my bank account, I was read a scripted response from the customer service person I spoke with. I was told that they'd look into and that my money would be refunded. However, I didn't hear anything for a couple of days. So I called back and had to ONCE AGAIN, relay my story. I was then read the same scripted response. This happened multiple days in a row so I finally had had it and demanded to speak with someone in authority. I was then patched through to a supervisor who then read me the same scripted responses. When I demanded to speak with the &#34;investigative team&#34; that he kept referencing, he informed me that he didn't have the ability to connect me to them but that someone would call me back ASAP. I never heard from anyone. I was finally so angry and frustrated that I finally called and had my bank (Chase) reverse the charges and look into it.

I like Amazon so much that I made a substantial investment in purchasing Amazon stock last year.  I just learned about the Amazon Gift Cards about a month ago and have been considering purchasing ten $500.00 cards as gifts.  I have read hundreds of the 5-Star reviews as well as the 1-Star reviews.  I found that most of the 5-Star reviews were not at all helpful consisting of comments that do not say anything about the product.  Here are some samples of what most of them say.<br /><br />•  Good<br />•  Excellent<br />•  Muy bueno<br />•  Is what it is<br />•  Nice<br />•  Good gift<br />•  Gift<br />•  Great<br />•  Best<br />•  It was a good experience<br />•  Well received<br />•  No<br />•  Very good<br />•  Sweet<br />•  Delivered on time<br /><br />I didn't find any of these so-called 5-Star reviews to be helpful in any way.  However, it was in reading the 1-Star reviews that I found where purchasers of the gift cards commented about things that gave me concern.  Here are a few samples.<br /><br />1.  Worthless, works only with select products that are over $300.<br /><br />2.  The card was stolen in the mail and used by the thief (likely a postal employee). Amazon refused to replace the card or make a refund, even though, they know who illegally used the card. Amazon places the activation code on the back of the card so that whoever has the card, legitimately or illegitimately, can use it.  I also purchased Walmart gift cards to send to other relatives. Walmart mailed the cards to me, but emailed me the activation code. One of these cards was also stolen in the mail at the same time the Amazon card was stolen; however, since the activation code was not on the card, it could not be used by the thief. Walmart replaced this stolen card free of charge and sent itdirectly to my intended recipient.<br /><br />3.  I gave this gift card to my boyfriend and he bought an amazing product. After two days the purchase was cancelled, there was not items in stock.... What a scam... I can't return it....<br /><br />4.  My girlfriend lives in Romania and I live in the US. I sent her a Christmas gift card through email but she can't access the funds, even though the card shows as &#34;redeemed&#34; from my end.<br /><br />5.  I was out of the USA and could not use it. If it is US issued and paid, I feel robbed.<br /><br />There were numerous complaints similar to the last two examples where someone in one Country purchases a Gift Card that is sent to someone in another Country, and the recipient cannot use the card in their Country.  The purchaser will not be aware of this unless they navigate to the Amazon Terms and Conditions which reads:<br /><br />Limitations.<br />Gift Cards may not be redeemed for the purchase of products at www.amazon.at, www.amazon.com.br, www.amazon.ca, www.amazon.cn, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.es, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.in, www.amazon.it, www.amazon.co.jp, www.amazon.com.mx, www.amazon.co.uk, or any other website owned and operated by us.<br /><br />So why does Amazon allow these sales when they know that the recipient is located in a country where they will not be able to use the card?<br />On the Gift Card order page, below the Add to Order button is a small line of text that has a link to Amazon’s Terms and Conditions.<br /><br />The Terms and Conditions of the use of their Gift Cards include:<br />Amazon.com Gift Cards (&#34;Gift Cards&#34;) may only be redeemed toward the purchase of eligible goods and services provided by Amazon.com LLC and its affiliates (including redemption services provided by Amazon Payments, Inc.)  Redemption of Gift Cards on any affiliated website is subject to change in our sole discretion.<br /><br />I could not locate any information on the Amazon site defining what “eligible goods” are.<br /><br />What was really interesting and disconcerting to me is what I found to be missing on the Gift Card page; Customer Questions and Answers.  Amazon does not allow their customers to ask questions about their gift cards.  Why, do they have something to hide?  I personally feel that Amazon does not want to have customers ask questions as the answers may discourage one from purchasing a Gift Card.

My bank reversed the charge on my word and emails that explained but Amazon has refused to honor the credit card reversal.On the 22nd  I got a sweet little email from Amazon thanking me for changing me email address ( I did not) and there was NO WARNING as other vendors do like &#34;if you did not make this change notify us immediately&#34; .  I clicked on the link on my account and there was a new mail and a new password. I had no way of getting into my account,  I had to cancel two credit cards and any follow up  contact with Amazon was hopeless.
